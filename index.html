     <h1>Dogo Argentinos Food</h1>
     <p>Depending on the size of your dog as an adult you are going to want to feed them a
     formula that will cater to their unique digestive needs through the various phases of their life.
   The water that you give them needs to be clean at all times. At  first I did
 not know about this at first. But then when my dog started having sezures, I started
searching on what was going on. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.

Many dog food companies have breed-specific formulas for small, medium, large and giant breeds.
 Dogo Argentinos are a large breed. What you feed your dog is an individual choice,
 but working with your veterinarian and/or breeder is a good choice. To determin a good meal
for your Dogo, to increase his longevity. </p>
